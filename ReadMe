<Index.html - Home Page>
   The home page includes a navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Login pages.

   The main section contains an image, an h1 tag, a slogan, and a collection of images.
   Following the main section, there is an info section that explains what the home page offers. This section highlights three parts:

    1. The first part displays images of products.
    2. The second part provides information about the minerals found in fruits and vegetables.
    3. The last part allows users to calculate the calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates they consume based on the fruit name and quantity entered.

    The footer provides additional information.

<About.html - About Page>
    This page includes the same navigation bar and footer as the home page.
    It provides information about the farm, key personnel, and answers to frequently asked questions. Users can press the down arrow to view the answers.
    Additionally, it features embedded iframes or videos showcasing daily farm activities, uploaded to YouTube.

<Login.html - Login Page>
    Users can log in if they are registered, meaning their information is stored in localStorage and the provided email and password match.
    The login page temporarily saves the email and password in sessionStorage during the session.

<Register.html - Register Page>
    When users fill out the input fields correctly, their information is saved in localStorage. This allows them to log in later using the saved data and access the page.


Unfortunately, I haven't implemented a feature for users to place orders, so they cannot make purchases at this time.

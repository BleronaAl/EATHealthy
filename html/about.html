    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p> We proudly offer a wide selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, 
        perfect for your everyday needs. From vibrant, juicy fruits to crisp, farm-fresh

    <p> Calories, proteins, and essential minerals play a vital role in keeping your body healthy 
        and functioning properly. Calories provide the energy needed for daily activities and bodily 
        processes, while proteins are crucial for building and repairing muscles, tissues, and cells.
    </p>

    <p>Our website offers a unique tool that calculates the minerals and nutrients you consume based on 
        the fruits and vegetables you eat. By simply selecting the items you've had, our platform analyzes 
        their nutritional content, providing a detailed breakdown of essential minerals like calcium, 
        potassium, iron, and more.
